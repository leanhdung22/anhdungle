<p> My aunt started her undergraduate studies in Physics, only to drop it one year later. Nevertheless, I inherited her textbooks and, when I was twelve years old, it was with joy that I tried to comprehend physics at a much higher level than the one I was used to. I remember that, of all those books I inherited and foreseeing my career choices, my personal favorite was "Optics and Quantum Physics".
